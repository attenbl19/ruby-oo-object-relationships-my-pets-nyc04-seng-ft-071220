# Define a `Dog` and `Cat` class that have the attributes required by the
#   test suite. Keep in mind, some of the attributes should be readable and writable
#   (i.e. `attr_accessor`s), while others may need to be _just_ setters
#   (`attr_writer`) or _just_ getters (`attr_reader`). The test suite will make this
#   clear so pay attention to the test output.
